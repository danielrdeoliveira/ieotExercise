# ieotExercise
Exercise proposed by ieot.

Given a text file ("schedules.txt") containing the names and the schedule for worked hours of the employees, the program reads the file, iterates through it and then calculates the payment for each employee.

In this proposed architecture, a file class is designed ("file_open.py") as well as an employee class ("employee.py").

The "main.py" file contains the instantiation of the classes and, when run, prints the desired output. 
That's the file that should be run locally.

On top of that, a folder with tests was added, where a few methods and cases were tested using the pytest library, for unit tests.
